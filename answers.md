## 1. Achievement
>Tell me about the achievement, that you are most proud of? It can be a personal project or
something you’ve worked on professionally. Just a short paragraph is fine but I would like to
know why you’re proud of it.

I was the Scrum Master of the team that first brought ApplePay in Europe. I am proud of this because it feels good to be a pioneer and to accomplish something like this.

## 2. Tech read
>Tell me about a technical book, blog post or article you read recently, why you liked it, and
   why I should read it?

I recently read [this article](https://medium.com/@mail_50938/designing-a-service-for-password-less-temporary-access-to-resources-e0bbb5b7a22b) because I had to investigate a similar functionality of temporary access to a resource. I found inspiration is some parts of it. I think you should read it if you have to design something similar.

## 3. Leadership values
>In a senior position there will be situations where your leadership is required - What are
    your key values as a leader? How do you demonstrate these values? Please describe
    concrete measures that you have taken in the past.

Some of the values I have demonstrated as a leader are
* Asking the right questions - communication between different teams can be tricky at times. There were a lot of times when I "sensed" what my colleagues did not understand and I asked the right questions in order to help them understand the issue/problem/product detail.
* Teamwork - even as a backend developer, if we go live in two weeks, and the frontend colleagues are in deep trouble with an endless list of bugs, you roll up your sleeves, and you write some javascript. The "I-HATE-JAVASCRIPT-ERS" will follow, after the standard 5 minutes of complaints :)
* Honesty - Admitting when you are wrong and fixing your mistakes - this is setting an example for the others to do the same. These behaviours have a good chance of eliminating a toxic environment that could lead to hiding mistakes (which can aggravate them), or cause misunderstandings between colleagues by passing blame.
  * "It was my mistake" is something that every leader should be humble enough to admit - sooner or later even the most qualified, brilliant and responsible person will make a mistake and one should be responsible enough to admit it and to fix it.
* Respect your company's, your colleagues' and your own **_time_**. 
  * It's important for everyone's emotional and physical well-being to be focused on work when you are at work, and to be focused on your own life in your own time. Overtime can happen exceptionally to finish the work for a deadline, but it should be that - an **_exception_** - not the rule. How do I apply this? I rarely do overtime, if you keep focused at work you don't have to do overtime, I don't use social media at all which helps me stay focused, and I never disturb my colleagues with work-related problems outside working hours or on vacations.
